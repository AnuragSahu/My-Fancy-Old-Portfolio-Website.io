                    Hey there Folks! Let me start by Introducing myself by my name, my Name is Anurag Sahu, I am a silent person I have to work on my communication skills but if I get comfortable with you, I might be the most talkative and extrovert person you will find on planet earth, I love to make things Automatic, I love writing small scripts which will make my work lesser, I am biigggggg fan of github, I sometimes wonder how can such an small platform for just sharing your code with the world be soo awesome. You can talk to me about interesting projects, or Fitness protiens or how did I lost the my weight that too thrice I might not be the best advice for you but I am certainly someone in front of whom you will not feel inferior. </p>
                    <p>
                    <br>
                    Ohk More About me section, honestly I don't know what else is left to tell you about myself There is a More About me section in the Template and I have to Fill this Section, And am not letting this opportunity go, Lets get a little deeper here:-</p>
                    <p><br>
                    Starting from my birth, I was born in an hospital in Tilda, It is a place in Chhattisgarh my father was an Engineer at Century Cement Plant at that time, I was the first child in the house, even my father was the Only male child and Even my Grand Father was the only male child of his parents, So you can surely say That I was pampered like anything,</p>
                    <p><br>
                    Later my younger brother was born, surprisingly he was just an year younger than me  every body in the locality used to say that he couldn't see me with his parents alone for any longer so he came early, he was very very mischevious we did evey crazy thing we could possibly do we used to buy some cheap helicopters from the toy shop fly it from the top floor of our building just to see our brand me toy smashing into the ground for the sake of our curiosity,</p>
