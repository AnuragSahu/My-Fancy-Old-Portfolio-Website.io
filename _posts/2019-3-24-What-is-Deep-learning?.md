title: What is BackPropagation?
---

The world is mad around the buzz words like Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Neural Networks, Block Chain development and what not, Its feels like an insult to the these words when some newbies use them as their titles, I wont mention their names here but I have seen some of students who have just Started with their in course "Introduction to Artificial intelligence" and call themselves Professional AI expert,

I am amazed by the confidence shown by such people they are those kind of people who have just entered and running like a sheep behind the buzz words.
